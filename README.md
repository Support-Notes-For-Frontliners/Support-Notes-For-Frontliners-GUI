# Description
Support Notes For Frontliners GUI is a backend system for Support Notes For Frontliners to allow for easy approval of real-time notes. These notes are meant to be a show of support, so this GUI creates a simple and easy way to filter out any troll messages and keep the notes friendly and supportive.
